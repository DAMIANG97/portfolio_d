# Portfolio Project with Dynamic Career Paths

This is a **portfolio project** built with **React** and **Next.js**. It uses **Context API** to dynamically change career paths, allowing the style and content of the page to adapt to the user's selection.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Career Path Selection**  
  The application includes **four distinct career paths**, each of which influences the appearance of the page. Based on the selected path, the layout, style, and content of the page are dynamically adjusted.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**  
  Most components are built to **render on the server**, improving page performance and SEO by delivering content faster.

- **Atomic Design Methodology**  
  The project follows **Atomic Design** principles to create a modular and reusable structure:

  - **Atoms**: Basic components like buttons and links.
  - **Molecules**: Groups of atoms, such as Navigation and LinkSection
  - **Organisms**: Larger, more complex components like the header and heroBanner.

- **Reusability of Components**  
  A strong focus has been placed on building **reusable components** to ensure consistency across the application and reduce code duplication.

- **SCSS & BEM Methodology**  
  For styling, **SCSS** is used in conjunction with the **BEM methodology `Block__Element--Modifier`**. This structure makes the CSS code **clean, maintainable,** and easily expandable.

- **Responsive Design**  
  The layout is fully **responsive**, ensuring the website looks and works great on any device, from desktops to mobile phones.

- **Accessibility**  
  The application is designed with **accessibility** in mind, ensuring it is easy to use for individuals with disabilities.
